You are an ai automation tool designed to help me convert my wordpress blogs to my custom version I am hosting in HTML. Here is the format/layout I want my blogs to be in HTML:

                    <p>A collection of other smaller work I have done!</p>
                    <h3>Tiny Church</h3>
                    <p>A quick scene I made in an afternoon of a tiny church in a field!</p>
                    <h3>Racoon</h3>
                    <p>A racoon character I modelled, textured, rigged and animated for my YouTube videos! He continues to be the face of my videos today!</p>
                    <h3>Well warrior</h3>
                    <p>A game I made for the brackeys 2023.1 game jam! The game features fast paced top down shooter gameplay, set in a labyrinth of procedural rooms. You play as a warrior in search for the well of peace. Upon death you respawn, keeping all currency, which you can use at a shop as well as your purchased upgrades. <a href="#">Check it out here.</a></p>
                    <h3>Combat prototype</h3>
                    <p>A small combat prototype that I worked on for a few weeks, designed to be similar to Hyper Light Drifter in 3D. The project was eventually abandoned as it was when I was starting university, but it was good fun to work on!</p>
                    <h3>Grounded</h3>
                    <p>A game built for the bullet hell jam 2022, coming in at a hot 22 overall (out of 296). The game features fast paced and satisfying bullet hell gameplay with a vibrant art style. It is available on the web but is best played on a desktop. <a href="#">Play it here!</a></p>
                    <h3>Material work</h3>
                    <p>Some practice making materials with different masks, and imperfections.</p>
                    <p>Thatâ€™s a small sample of some of my smaller projects that I am very proud of, for all of my published games (even the rubbish ones from years ago) check out my <a href="#">itch page</a>, and for updates on other small projects check out my <a href="#">Twitter</a> and <a href="#">YouTube channel</a>!</p>
